Odoo addon providing 2-way integration with frePPLe advanced planning.

The connectors are composed of 3 modules:
- frepple: This is the core of the connectors to make frepple and odoo exchange data.
- autologin: This module is used to automatically log a user to an Odoo instance. We use this module in our online Odoo demo instances for a better user experience.
- freppledata: This is a sample dataset that we load in our online Odoo demo instances.

Note: To connect a frepple instance to an existing Odoo instance, only the frepple module is required.
